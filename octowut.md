__What is this?__  \r\nOctopub is.. ehm.. a thing. I guess it\'s sort of a mix between an imageboard, twitter and the YouTube comments section. It\'s a mess, and it\'s quite awesome. Threads are Temporary and volatile.   \r\n\r\n__Rules:__  \r\nOctopub has two simple rules. \r\n1. Don\'t break the law.  \r\n2. Don\'t be an ass.  \r\n\r\nRule 1 is enforced, rule 2 is not, but please just don\'t. Also, breaking the site intentionally is seen as being an ass. If you discover a vulnerability, please contact me.  \r\n\r\n__IDs:__  \r\nIDs are a way of temporarily identifying individuals. They can be seen in the right side of any thread or reply. IDs are here to make conversation with others possible while still remaining anonymous. Your current id can be seen in the colored circle in the top right. Clicking the button to the left of it assigns you a new id.   \r\n\r\n__Threads:__  \r\nThreads are created by clicking the + icon in the top right corner. This opens a prompt where a thread Title and description can be specified. The thread is submitted by clicking the submit button. Your id is then changed to that of the new thread. This is done to make it easy to recognize the OP.\r\nThreads will be usually deleted after around a day of inactivity. This value can vary from just half an hour, to two whole weeks depending on amount of activity in the thread and total amount of activity on the whole site.  \r\n\r\n__Markdown:__  \r\nThread descriptions and replies have full markdown support.\r\nCheatsheet [here](https:\/\/github.com\/adam-p\/markdown-here\/wiki\/Markdown-Cheatsheet)  \r\nA couple of useful tings:\r\n\\_ _For italic_ \\_, \\_\\_ __For bold__ \\_\\_  \r\n\\!\\[alt\\]\\(url\\) To insert an image.  \r\nTwo spaces and an enter for newline, two enters for new paragraph.\r\nOh, and to enter an enter instead of sending the message, try holding shift\r\n\r\n__Images:__  \r\nImages can be uploaded by dragging an image into the textbox or clicking the browse button. Images have a max size of 10 mb, and are stored for 4 days before being deleted.  \r\n\r\n__WebM \/ GIFv:__  \r\nSo one night i stayed up far too late... And now there\'s webm\/gifv support. WebMs are submitted the same way as normal images. Either by uploading them, or as \\!\\[alt\\]\\(url\\) \r\n\r\n__Repository:__  \r\nThe full OctoPub sourcecode is available [here](https:\/\/bitbucket.org\/SilasAlroe\/octopub). You are welcome to do whatever with it.
